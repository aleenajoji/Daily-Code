        <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>What is Machine Learning?</p>
        <p> Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability 
            to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML is one of the most exciting 
            technologies that one would have ever come across. As it is evident from the name,
             it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans: The ability to learn. 
             Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than 
             one would expect.
            
            </p>
            <p>Features of Machine learning </p>
            <p>Machine learning is data driven technology. Large amount of data 
                generated by organizations on daily bases. So, by notable relationships
                 in data, organizations makes better decisions.
                Machine can learn itself from past data and automatically improve.
                From the given dataset it detects various patterns on data.
                For the big organizations branding is important and it will become more 
                easy to target relatable customer base.
                It is similar to data mining because it is also deals with the huge 
                amount of data.</p>
                <p>ML | Introduction to Data in Machine Learning </p>
                <p>Data is a crucial component in the field of Machine Learning. It 
                    refers to the set of observations or measurements that can be used to 
                    train a machine-learning model. The quality and quantity of data available 
                    for training and testing play a significant role in determining the performance 
                    of a machine-learning model. Data can be in various forms such as 
                    numerical, categorical, or time-series data, and can come from various
                     sources such as databases, spreadsheets, or APIs. Machine learning algorithms
                      use data to learn patterns and relationships between input variables and 
                      target outputs, which can then be used for prediction or classification 
                      tasks.Data is typically divided into two types: 

                      Labeled data
                      Unlabeled data

        <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
        <p>Introduction to Deep Learning</p>
        <p>Deep learning is a branch of machine learning which is based on artificial neural networks. It is capable of learning complex patterns and relationships within data. In deep learning, we don’t need to explicitly program everything. It has become increasingly popular in recent years due to the advances in processing power and the availability of large datasets. Because it is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) also known as deep neural networks (DNNs). These neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain’s biological neurons, and they are designed to learn from large amounts of data.

            Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that involves the use of neural networks to model and solve complex problems. Neural networks are modeled after the structure and function of the human brain and consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process and transform data.
            The key characteristic of Deep Learning is the use of deep neural networks, which have multiple layers of interconnected nodes. These networks can learn complex representations of data by discovering hierarchical patterns and features in the data. Deep Learning algorithms can automatically learn and improve from data without the need for manual feature engineering.
            Deep Learning has achieved significant success in various fields, including image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and recommendation systems. Some of the popular Deep Learning architectures include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs).
            Training deep neural networks typically requires a large amount of data and computational resources. However, the availability of cloud computing and the development of specialized hardware, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), has made it easier to train deep neural networks.
            In summary, Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that involves the use of deep neural networks to model and solve complex problems. Deep Learning has achieved significant success in various fields, and its use is expected to continue to grow as more data becomes available, and more powerful computing resources become available.</p> 
            
            <p> What is Deep Learning? </p>
          <p> Deep learning is the branch of machine learning which is based on artificial neural network architecture. An artificial neural network or ANN uses layers of interconnected nodes called neurons that work together to process and learn from the input data.
            
            In a fully connected Deep neural network, there is an input layer and one or more hidden layers connected one after the other. Each neuron receives input from the previous layer neurons or the input layer. The output of one neuron becomes the input to other neurons in the next layer of the network, and this process continues until the final layer produces the output of the network. The layers of the neural network transform the input data through a series of nonlinear transformations, allowing the network to learn complex representations of the input data.

            <h2>Deep Neural Network</h2>
            <p>What is a deep neural network?
                At its simplest, a neural network with some level of complexity, usually at least two layers, qualifies as a deep neural network (DNN), or deep net for short. Deep nets process data in complex ways by employing sophisticated math modeling.
                
                To truly understand deep neural networks, however, it’s best to see it as an evolution. A few items had to be built before deep nets existed.</p>
    <p>First, machine learning had to get developed. ML is a framework to automate (through algorithms) statistical models, like a linear regression model, to get better at making predictions. A model is a single model that makes predictions about something. Those predictions are made with some accuracy. A model that learns—machine learning—takes all its bad predictions and tweaks the weights inside the model to create a model that makes fewer mistakes.

        The learning portion of creating models spawned the development of artificial neural networks. ANNs utilize the hidden layer as a place to store and evaluate how significant one of the inputs is to the output. The hidden layer stores information regarding the input’s importance, and it also makes associations between the importance of combinations of inputs.</p>

            <h1>Robotics</h1>
            <p>Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of computer science and engineering.
                 Robotics involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. 
                 The goal of robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans. 
                 Robotics integrates fields of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, 
                 information engineering, mechatronics engineering, electronics, biomedical
                  engineering, computer engineering, control systems engineering, software 
                  engineering, mathematics, etc.</p>

               <p> Robotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate
                 human actions. Robots can be used in many situations for many purposes, 
                 but today many are used in dangerous environments (including inspection
                  of radioactive materials, bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing
                   processes, or where humans cannot survive (e.g., in space, underwater, 
                   in high heat, and clean up and containment of hazardous materials and
                    radiation). Robots can take any form, but some are made to resemble
                     humans in appearance. This is claimed to help in the acceptance of robots
                      in certain replicative behaviors which are usually performed by people.
                       Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or
                        any other tasks mainly performed by a human. Many of today's robots
                         are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired
                          robotics.</p>
                
               <p> Certain robots require user input to operate, while other robots function
                 autonomously. The concept of creating robots that can operate autonomously
                  dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and 
                  potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century.
                   Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed by various scholars,
                    inventors, engineers, and technicians that robots will one day be able
                     to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion. Today,
                      robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue;
                       researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical
                        purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily. Many robots
                         are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as defusing
                          bombs, finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring mines and
                           shipwrecks. Robotics is also used in STEM (science, technology,
                            engineering, and mathematics) as a teaching aid.
                
                Etymology
                The word robotics was derived from the word robot, which was introduced
                 to the public by Czech writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. 
                 (Rossum's Universal Robots), which was published in 1920. The word robot
                  comes from the Slavic word robota, which means work/job. The play begins
                   in a factory that makes artificial people called robots, creatures who
                    can be mistaken for humans – very similar to the modern ideas of androids.
                     Karel Čapek himself did not coin the word. He wrote a short letter in 
                     reference to an etymology in the Oxford English Dictionary in which 
                     he named his brother Josef Čapek as its actual originator.
                
                According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word robotics was
                 first used in print by Isaac Asimov, in his science fiction short story 
                 "Liar!", published in May 1941 in Astounding Science Fiction. Asimov was
                  unaware that he was coining the term; since the science and technology 
                  of electrical devices is electronics, he assumed robotics already referred
                   to the science and technology of robots. In some of Asimov's other works,
                   he states that the first use of the word robotics was in his short story
                    Runaround (Astounding Science Fiction, March 1942),
                     where he introduced his concept of The Three Laws of Robotics. 
                     However, the original publication of "Liar!" predates that of
                      "Runaround" by ten months, so the former is generally cited as the
                       word's origin.</p>

            <h2>Fuzzy Logic</h2>
            <p>Fuzzy Logic | Introduction</p>
            <p>The term fuzzy refers to things that are not clear or are vague. In the real world many times we encounter a situation when we can’t determine whether the state is true or false, their fuzzy logic provides very valuable flexibility for reasoning. In this way, we can consider the inaccuracies and uncertainties of any situation. 

                Fuzzy Logic is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth values of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1, instead of just the traditional values of true or false. It is used to deal with imprecise or uncertain information and is a mathematical method for representing vagueness and uncertainty in decision-making.
                
                Fuzzy Logic is based on the idea that in many cases, the concept of true or false is too restrictive, and that there are many shades of gray in between. It allows for partial truths, where a statement can be partially true or false, rather than fully true or false.
                
                Fuzzy Logic is used in a wide range of applications, such as control systems, image processing, natural language processing, medical diagnosis, and artificial intelligence.</p>
                
               <p> The fundamental concept of Fuzzy Logic is the membership function, which defines the degree of membership of an input value to a certain set or category. The membership function is a mapping from an input value to a membership degree between 0 and 1, where 0 represents non-membership and 1 represents full membership.
                
                Fuzzy Logic is implemented using Fuzzy Rules, which are if-then statements that express the relationship between input variables and output variables in a fuzzy way. The output of a Fuzzy Logic system is a fuzzy set, which is a set of membership degrees for each possible output value.
                
                In summary, Fuzzy Logic is a mathematical method for representing vagueness and uncertainty in decision-making, it allows for partial truths, and it is used in a wide range of applications. It is based on the concept of membership function and the implementation is done using Fuzzy rules.
                
                In the boolean system truth value, 1.0 represents the absolute truth value and 0.0 represents the absolute false value. But in the fuzzy system, there is no logic for the absolute truth and absolute false value. But in fuzzy logic, there is an intermediate value too present which is partially true and partially false. </p>
